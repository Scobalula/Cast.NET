# Cast.NET

A .NET Library for reading and writing Cast files.

# Note

This library is a WIP but is functional and is capable of properly reading and writing cast files. A lot of work is being put into cleaning up the library, adding more helper methods and refactorying a lot of how individual nodes are handled. If you want to help, feel free to file PRs, examples are included for a basic on how to use the library. Documentation is being worked on but all methods are documented.
